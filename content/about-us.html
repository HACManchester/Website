HAC:Manchester is a Hackspace Group, a community-run arts, science and technology club.  We run weekly workshop sessions, providing electronics, mechanical and computing knowledge, and a shared workshop space for personal and group projects.

Our aim is to provide a space where people can work on their projects, hang out socially to talk about making things, plot world domination* and work together to develop their collective skills.

Youâ€™ll find us every Wednesday evening, downstairs at the MadLab, in Manchester's Northern Quarter.
